-- A customer's own order is accepted only while the shop is open.
--
-- After close_shop the distributor starts arranging from the day's orders,
-- and the Bubble PRD (close-shop-phase-3) is explicit: "after close_shop,
-- customer order entry must reject new orders". Ori's order screen checks
-- the phase right before it sends, but submit_order itself only refused a
-- CLOSED day — so an order sent in the moment of closing, from a screen
-- that had not yet heard the shop closed, or straight through the API, was
-- accepted and changed the numbers under the arrangement.
--
-- Two changes to submit_order, nothing else:
--   1. a customer's own send is refused (P0007) unless the phase is
--      shop_open. Staff ordering on a customer's behalf keep their current
--      rule: allowed until the day closes;
--   2. the phase is read `for share`, so a send and close_shop are put in
--      order — whichever comes first finishes first, and a send that comes
--      second sees the shop already closed.
--
-- The function is copied unchanged from 0068, its latest definition, apart
-- from the blocks marked "0071". Safe to run more than once.

  'Customer-only for their own company (p_customer_company_id omitted). Backoffice-only when p_customer_company_id is supplied. One transaction: upserts-and-prunes daily_order_products from p_lines, sets the order to submitted and stamps submitted_at, writes one order_submission_logs row (attributed to whoever actually called this), and — only on a direct customer submission, never the backoffice-on-behalf-of path — enqueues one order_submitted notification to backoffice (id 6) and rejects (P0008) any line raised above max_orderable_for_customer() for that variety (a line kept at, or lowered from, its saved quantity is accepted even when stock has since dropped below it — migration 0068). Also computes, for every variety this call''s lines could have pushed across a threshold, whether it just became fully-ordered-with-overbooking-room (stock_overbooking_reached, id 10) or fully-exhausted (stock_fully_exhausted, id 11) — live, in this same transaction, never via a stored out-of-stock list or trigger. A pruned line that an arrangement_records row points at is zeroed rather than deleted, so re-saving an order can no longer cascade away the distributor''s allocations. Sends for one trading day run one at a time (a transaction-level advisory lock, 0068), so two customers can never both take the same last pallets. Raises P0007 if the trading day is closed, or — for a customer''s own order — if the shop is not open (phase shop_open; migration 0071, which also reads the phase `for share` so a send and close_shop can never cross), P0008 if a line references a variety not in today''s shop, has a negative pallet count, or (direct customer submissions only) raises a line above the per-customer cap.';
